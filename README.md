# Propability and Statisctics

## Tasks:
1. Finding approximation of the number pi using geometric probability.
2. Making a pseudo-random generator of numbers with the probability density function being the sides of the trapezoid.
3. Making a pseudo-random generator of numbers with Poisson's distribution and finding their probability distribution.
4. Making a pseudo-random generator of numbers with chi-square distribution with three degrees of freedom. Box-Muller transformation.
